<p>Wow, this has been / will continue to be quite a year.</p>
<p>This year, 2008, I graduated with honors from Gordon College, was inducted in to the Phi Alpha Chi honors society, got engaged, will get married, will become <em>officially</em> moved out of my house in New Hampshire (although I haven't really lived there in awhile, except over last Christmas break), was accepted into two PhD. graduate programs for mathematics, deferred for one of them, got a job as a software/database developer, and will eventually purchase my second car.</p>
<p>Not only that, but I have been out to Minnesota once already this year (where I proposed), am flying to Colorado tomorrow, will be taking a honeymoon somewhere in September, and then will be going back to Minnesota for a second wedding reception for all of Alice's friends and family who could not make it out here.</p>
<p>I don't think I've ever done so many things in any one year of my life before...or even any five years!</p>
<p>I'm so thankful for how blessed Alice and I have been this year - blessed by God and our families.  Alice and I are even going to be working close to each other (just a town or two apart), which will make our living situation very manageable.  And, since Mike is PhD'ing himself in Amherst, we'll still be able to get together semi-regularly.  And we'll be living a whole 20ish minutes closer!  w00t!</p>
