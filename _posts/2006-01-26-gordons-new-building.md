<p>I just want to give a nod to the team behind the construction of Gordon's latest structure.  It's probably about 24 feet by 15 feet, made from snow bricks which were made using the recycling bins every student here is provided with.  Inside there are three levels, and the only way in is through a small hole that you have to crawl through on your belly.  It's amazing, and everyone involved deserves a GPA boost.</p>
