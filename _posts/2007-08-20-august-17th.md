So much happened last Friday (August 17th) that I can't come up with an appropriate title for this post.

First of all, it was the last day of my twelve weeks of summer research.  It wrapped up pretty quietly.  I had been working on a proof that ended up being incorrect, and a program that ended up not working as we hoped, but my professor tells me he thinks both will still be useful in the future, at least as a starting point for something else.  Perhaps it is true, and perhaps he means to make me feel better.  I'm not sure.   It was also Alice's last day as a camp councilor.  It was also our anniversary!

Alice called me at about 1:00 PM on Friday, which was unusual - she had never made a phone call from work before, that I was aware of.  She said "Hey - how would you like to go to the Patriots game tonight?  My boss can give me two free tickets, worth $90.00 each."  Well!  I said of course I'd like to go, I've never been to a professional sporting event before, and a Patriots game would be my first choice of one to go to.  Unfortunately, she hung up and as soon as she did I realized that we had no real way to get to Gilette stadium in Foxboro - neither one of us have cars, and the train doesn't go out there. (Actually, it does - but only one train goes, and we couldn't catch that one in time.)  So I attempted calling back, but she had put her phone back on silent.  I guessed (correctly) that she thought the stadium was right in Boston, which it isn't - if it had been, we could have taken the train in no problem.

Anyway, we ended up finding a car to borrow.  Actually, a massive, handicap-ramp equipped van is what we found, but it still got us there.  We left for our supposed 1-hour journey at 6:45 (kickoff was at 8:00), knowing we'd be late but figuring we'd get in by 8:30ish.  We were both very naive, having never done this before.  We had about $17 between us when we got near the stadium (at 8:15), and soon discovered that traffic was crazy and horrible, and parking costs $40.  Long story short: after much driving, and me running into the stadium to find an ATM, and Alice driving around to find one, Alice ended up getting cash first but getting to the lot so late in the game that they didn't charge for parking (which was nice).  We ended up getting to see all of the second half of the game.  I saw the last bits of the first half while I wait for Alice to park too.

We had decent seats.  Several people came down to get their pictures taken next to our seat since there was a good view of the stadium there; all who came said it was either their first game, their anniversary, or both.  The guys behind us asked us "Say, it doesn't happen to be your first game too, does it?"  We said "Actually, it is, AND it's our anniversary!"  So he kindly took our picture for us, and we got a good laugh.

The Patriots ended up loosing to the Titans (my grandfather in Tennessee is happy, at least), and despite the headache of getting there and not getting to bed till really late (nearly 2:30 AM), it was a good experience and a lot of fun.

The next day I was up at about 7:50AM, preparing to move out.  Dad came and helped me move out and move back to Gordon; Alice also came to help out, which was very nice.  I finished unpacking and moving in by around 10:30 that night.  So now I'm back at Gordon, and have one more day off before I start work again, and one week until classes resume.  Here comes my senior year.
