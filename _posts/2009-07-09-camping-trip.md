I am pleased to announce the release of Camping Trip 2009 (code named July). This is a major upgrade over past version of Camping Trip. The release notes are below.

<strong>Release Notes:</strong>

<strong>New Features</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Canoeing! You can now rent canoes and kayaks, although the fee is a little high.</li>
	<li>Charcoal grilling! You can now have tasty grilled hamburgers, onions, and other things cooked over an open flame.</li>
	<li>Video! You can now take video of your camping trip, in addition to digital pictures. (To be posted soon.)</li>
	<li>Dry wood! Even though most of the wood around is drenched, you will be supplied with a stack of pre-split dry wood.</li>
	<li>Lean-to! You now have enough trees, ropes, bungees, and cleverness to construct a reliable tarp-based shelter next to your camp fire.</li>
	<li>Bathrooms! Not just made out of trees anymore.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Bug Fixes</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Inclement weather has been significantly reduced. Even when it torrentially rains locally, it will only do so while you are in the car and away from your camp site. Rainfall on your campsite will be minimal, if at all, and will not effect sleeping or your ability to start a fire.</li>
	<li>Loud neighbors have been removed.</li>
	<li>Fellow campers who don't pull their weight have been removed.</li>
	<li>The number of pesky bugs has been reduced, although not at all eliminated. They should respond better to citronella candles as well.</li>
	<li>Hikes that lead to certain death have been replaced with leisurely scenic drives and walks.</li>
	<li>Birds now cooperate better to having their pictures taken while doing interesting things.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Known Issues</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The tent may leak water in through the bottom, causing your sleeping bag and other things to get wet. This should be fixed in the next release.</li>
	<li>The canopy's metal frame is broken, leaving sharp, jagged edges exposed and greatly reducing structural integrity.</li>
	<li>Sleeping pads were left at home, causing sleep to be awful and/or completely unavailable.</li>
</ul>
Overall I am very happy with this release of Camping Trip. The unit tests pass with 93% coverage.

(Note: Yes, writing about my camping trip in the form of a software release is, perhaps, one of the nerdiest things I have done. Pictures to follow.)
