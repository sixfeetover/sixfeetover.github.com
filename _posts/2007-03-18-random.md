Did you know 1239098123098123 is prime?  Neither did I, but when I went to show <a title="Badongadong" href="http://www.theory37.com">Mike</a> a math program I've been playing with, I showed him how quickly the is_prime() function works, which unsurprisingly tells you whether or not a number is prime.  I completely randomly typed 1239098123098123, and it returned "True".  I also guessed 1231231 was prime a couple weeks ago.  Do I have some kind of inherit prime-guessing skill?
