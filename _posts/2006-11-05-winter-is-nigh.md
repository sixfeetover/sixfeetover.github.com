Last Friday marked my second Gordon Globes victory in a row.  My friend Chris and I made <em>Mouse, MD</em> - a parody of House MD, which is more or less the best show on TV. The basic plot was that I (Mouse) was a genius computer repair diagnostician who saved the computer which controls all the student data at Gordon.  We spent copious amounts of hours on the darn thing...many, many late nights (some till 4:00 in the morning for me; one night Chris never left the video editing lab).  I spent 20 hours on the 21 second title sequence.  In any case, we won Best Picture for the night, which was really rewarding.  The best part was when the audience erupted in applause when they saw the giant M on the screen and instantly knew what our movie was.

In other news, I bought egg nog yesterday.  Nothing says "Holiday season" like a cup of 'nog.
