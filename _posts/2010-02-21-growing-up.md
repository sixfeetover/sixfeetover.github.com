Sometimes I wonder what I will be when I grow up. I'm currently a software developer, a field in which age discrimination is rampant. Software developers have trouble finding work after age 40, at least work as a software developer. That's probably one reason so many become managers.

I had a couple chance meetings a couple months ago that struck me. The first was at the Topsfield Fair. I stopped by to see the blacksmith display (which, incidentally, was really great) and spoke to one of the guys there. He asked me what my line of work was, and when I said "software engineer", he replied by saying "Ah yes. I did my time as a software engineer on the North Shore, too. I gave it up and now I'm doing what I love." What he loved was being a blacksmith and a martial artist (martial arts being the second thing we had in common).

The other meeting was at Red Hook brewery. Alice and I took the tour there (which is only $1, and you get plenty of beer samples, <em>and</em> keep the glass - a great deal). Same response from this guy when he asked after my line of work: "Oh yeah, I did my time doing that. Now I'm doing what I love." What <em>he</em> loved was hanging out with his buddies, giving tours, and drinking great beer all day.

It makes me wonder what I will be doing for work when I'm 40. Of course, there's a big difference between those guys and me: I don't feel at all like I am "doing my time" - I love my job and will be happy to work there for a long time yet.
