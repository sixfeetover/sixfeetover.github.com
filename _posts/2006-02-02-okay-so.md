I hope I'm not branded as being crazy as a result of this, but I'm actually trying one of these "win a free iPod" things.  It seems legitimate so far.  It's one of those deals where you sign up for some trial service and then refer five people to the site, and then you get an iPod out of it.  So, I joined to help a friend of mine, and signed up for a one week trial of some savings service which promised a wal-mart gift card.  I quit before the week was up, so it only cost me a dollar, and now I just need to refer 5 people myself and in theory I'll get an iPod.  So if anyone is feeling brave, click here: <span class="referraltext" /><a title="Help me out and get a free ipod!" href="http://ipods.freepay.com/?r=27006249"><span class="referraltext">http://ipods.freepay.com/?r=27006249</span></a><span class="referraltext">, sign up, refer me, help me get an iPod!  You MUST click on this link though for me to get a referal, you can't just go to ipods.freepay.com.  </span>

Thanks to anyone who signs up. :)
