After my long leave of absense.

This semester has kicked off with a three day weekend, so I've decided to take advantage of it and get some semblence of a web site up. To my embarrassment, I will be using an only slightly customized theme that I downloaded - this site is not 100% of my own making.  I've always taken some pride in having a personal site build from the ground up and coding by me, but that will have to wait for another three day weekend, or perhaps I'll edit it here and there during the semester - but no promises.

I've also switched from Movable Type to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>.  Movable Type kept breaking on me (hence the other site dying), and was slow due to being written in Perl.  WordPress is written in php and uses a mySQL database, both highly attractive features.  I'm impressed with it so far.

I'm happy to have a site back.  I've had only a few persistant appeals for its resurrection, so I've no idea how long it will take people to start visiting again, but oh well.  I've felt the itch recently to write.  My roommate Jared has been a good influence on me in that regard this year - when he has some thoughts on a subject, he writes them down.  I need to do the same, otherwise my thoughts are evanescent and never go anywhere.  I'm certainly not going to promise super-frequent updates, but it's at least safe to say "I'm back!"
