<strong>Abstract:</strong>  This paper will communicate it summary form the various activities which I have been involved in since the last post (non-inclusive).  As a warning, it may contain generic college-student statements making references to fatigue, homework, etc.  You have been warned.

<strong>1. School:</strong>  Classes are going well, but keeping me incredibly busy.  This year marks my first 300 level math course, the average difficulty per problem reflects that fact.  I also have the pleasure of having two massive projects to do this semester, one large paper, and an unreasonable amount of reading for the remaining class.  But I'm learning a lot and still managing to tread water, even if I'm swallowing a bit here and there.

<strong>2. Work:</strong>  I'm working more this year than I have in past years, which translates to complete elimination of free time and a bigger paycheck.  I work at CET more and I TA for the introductory computer science lab.  Fortunately this year we get to play with programming lego robots, so that should be fun.

<strong>3. Personal</strong>:  Apartment life has been great.  It's awesome to have a kitchen and the relative freedom of extended visitation.  It's difficult to find time to go shopping though, and there isn't exactly much variety in my diet.  But I'm working on it.  Being in an apartment also also allows Alice and I much more time together than we would otherwise have, which is a huge plus.  Also, Mike and Amy came to visit last weekend.  It was a blast and the first time they've been to Gordon (I visited mike two or three times at Norwich, so it was definitely his turn!)

<strong>4. Conclusion:</strong>  I keep hoping to catch up on work to have a few free hours to work on some personal projects.  So far it hasn't happened.

<strong>5. Footnote: </strong>I think my next computer will be a Mac.  PC loyalties = broken.
