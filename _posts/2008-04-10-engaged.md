This post is a little late, but on March 14th I proposed to Alice, and we are now engaged! We went out to Minnesota for spring break to visit her family, and I popped the question while we were out there. Her parents were in on the plot, which added to the fun. We of course called quite a few people that afternoon to share the news, and it turns out that her grandparents got engaged 55 years and 1 day before we did. Interestingly, we hope to get married in September, which would potentially mean we would also get <em>married</em> 55 years and 1 day after her grandparents did!

Now we are kind of scrambling to find a church to have the ceremony in, and a place to do the reception. Most places are extremely expensive. Google informs me that the average cost of a wedding these days is $15,000-$30,000 - ridiculous. We are going to spend only a fraction of that, and it will still be nice. If you have any ideas for venues to look in to, please tell us - we'd love to hear it. We're going for rustic but elegant, like a big lodge or something.

In other news, I was accepted with a full ride and stipend to Colorado State University for the PhD program in math; however, I am now planning on taking the year off so Alice and I can get married. That means I'm now in the job market, something I despise - I hate applying for things. Hopefully I'll find a technical job though - something to do with math and programming would be great.

I'm not sure if anyone still checks this site, but if so - thanks. :) I foresee myself keeping it more up to date in the near future, especially after graduation. I'll have to document all my photo trips with <a href="http://www.xanga.com/breathingair" title="The future Mrs. Sixfeetover">Alice</a>, <a href="http://www.theory37.com" title="Chicken Quesidilla">Mike</a>, and <a href="http://alongwayhome.blogspot.com/" title="The future Mrs. Quesidilla">Amy</a>.
