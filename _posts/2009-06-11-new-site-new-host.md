Well, I've finally moved my hosting from Worldpath to <a title="this*" href="http://www.thiswebhost.com/clients/aff.php?aff=065" target="_blank">this* web host</a> and I'm trying to get Wordpress set up. I found a decent them (ProudBlack) but I'd like to create my own theme. One more thing for the projects list! I also seem to have stupidly failed when I backed up all my old blog posts, so I'm not sure if I can get those back...I may be able to figure something out though.

I also plan to be setting Alice up with her own blog soon. For now - bed time.
