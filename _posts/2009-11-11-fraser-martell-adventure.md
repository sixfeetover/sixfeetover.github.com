I have not posted photos to my blog since a few random ones in college. Time to remedy that. Here is a selection of photos from another classic Fraser-Martell Adventure. We took a road trip out in Western Mass., ended up horribly lost, accidentally went to Vermont, and tried to navigate via the compass on my iPhone (which turned out to be quite handy) and some not-detailed-enough Google maps print outs. We were forced to eat Robin's minstrels, but in the end we made it out alive.
