I post so infrequently that every time I log in to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" title="WordPress">WordPress</a>, there's a new security release available.  Sigh.

My summer is going well, more or less.  I'm doing math research at Gordon - yes, there is such a thing, why do people keep looking at me like that? - with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming" title="Not worth your time">linear programs</a> (LPs), trying to discover some deep relationships between a primal LP and its dual, and trying to write some software in C++, which is rather difficult seeing as 1) I've used only Python for the last several months and 2) I don't know C++.  But I'll figure it out...the C++, that is - I'm still pretty stumped on the whole research bit.

I'm living in a fantastic Gordon-owned apartment this summer in Lynn.  Gordon owns 7 apartments here, and there are about 20 of us living here.  The kitchen is huge and the place is air conditioned - it doesn't get much better than that.  Plus, Alice lives right down the hall, so we get to see each other a lot, which is very nice.

None of my summer projects are coming to fruition.  I had hoped to be a Python master by the end of the summer, and I've gotten closer, but not as much as I wanted.  I haven't learned Blender 3D at all.  I haven't read any books.  I haven't taken the GREs.  Yikes - this is not a happy list!  I need to get cracking - there's not very much summer left.

To get things started, I'm going to go to bed.  I think the light from my laptop is bugging my roommate.  Perhaps I'll write more soon...I don't know if anyone reads my site anymore though!
