Still unbelievably busy. No time for anything, including this blog entry. This year's Gordon Globes movie due soon. Big exam Friday. Unreasonable amounts of reading to do, also for Friday. Must always sacrifice study quality of one class to do better in another, or sacrifice study quality for all class in exchange for sleep. It's the <a xhref="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a> of it all, as we discuss in economics. Projects of my own exist only in my mind; sometime maybe I'll see them come to fruition. They could be quite interesting if done well; one programming project, one philosophy project.
