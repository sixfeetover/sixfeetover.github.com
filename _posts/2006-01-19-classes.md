<p class="MsoNormal">Yesterday was my first full day of classes, even though the semester has been underway for a week.  I have two math classes, differential equations and linear algebra.  My professor, Dr. Senning, teaches both of those classes and was away at the <a href="http://www.maa.org">MAA</a>/<a href="http://www.ams.org">AMS</a> joint mathematical conference, so I didn't have a full day of classes till yesterday when he and the other profs returned.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was quite a busy day.  I logged over five hours at work and went to four classes.  Basically, my day went from 8AM to 9PM.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In any case, I think I'm going to rather enjoy my math classes, despite my rustiness.  I sat down with my old homework buddy Cassie, and it took us a long time figure out how to do an incredibly simple differential equation.  I'm sure it will come back quickly though.  It better, anyway â€“ I'm also going to be the TA for Calculus III next quad, so hopefully my integration and differentiation skills will come back to me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Time to do some linear algebra homework.  Stay tuned for a rant concerning Gordon's computer science department.</p>
