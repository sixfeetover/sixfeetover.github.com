Today I walked by a display case in Jenks, and I looked down and noticed that written in the dust on the display case was this note: "Bush isn't Christian!"  I was rather annoyed by this.  First, and ironically, writing a statement like that isn't Christian.  It is not our place to judge others' relationship with God.  Frankly, just because Bush's politics don't line up with yours doesn't mean he isn't a Christian.  Second, he may not be the brightest president America has had, but at least he is one of the few politicians who try to make decisions within a moral framework.  And have some sympathy - there isn't a person on this campus (including me) who could even come close to understand the degree of difficulty he must have trying to be leader of the free world with all the pressures of that world telling him his moral framework is not legitimate and that instead he should just do what they want.

It's true that I'm not much of a political person and I don't follow the goings on of this country as much as I should.  But I am of the opinion that most peoples' politics suck - so many people want to base policy off of completely arbitary values (that is, absolutely nothing), and a great many people seem to have it all figured out, which annoys me too.  My hat goes off to conservatives who are trying desperately to maintain some sense of real morals in this country and who recognize that not everyone can have their own personal arbitrary "values" which reduce to "I can do whatever I want, so get over it."

I walked back past that display case and erased the <em>n't</em> part of <em>isn't</em>. He says he is a Christian - it's between him and God, not us.
