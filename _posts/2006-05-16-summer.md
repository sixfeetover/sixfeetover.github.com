It's been awhile since the last post.  I have no excuse.

Finals went well for the most part.  My differential equations final was a bit of a beast  - it was a take-home that required quite a few hours to complete.  I did fine on it though.  In fact, I may have finally gotten a 4.0 this semester, depending on how rigorously my French exam is graded.

Alice is touring in Italy with the rest of the Wind Ensemble and college choir from school.  I'm jealous!  She managed to call me today from Italy though, I was very happy about that but it made me realize exactly how much I missed her.  She will be staying with us for a week after she gets back though - the highlight of my summer, no doubt!

I was talking with Mike the other day about summer plans and told him that I had the dull job of window washing lined up for me this summer.  He came to the rescue and told me about a tech support summer job for <a href="http://www.dhmc.org">Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center</a> that his mom had told him about.  I got very excited at the idea of doing a resumé building, intellectually stimulating, hopefully high paying job.  So, I began editing my resumé and cover letter with Alice's mom's help, and less than three business hours after submitting it got a phone call to set up an interview.  Tomorrow I'll be in Bedford at 10:00AM (it's a 1.5 hour drive) for my interview.  Hopefully it will all go well and I'll be a techie for the summer!

P.S. - <a href="http://novell.com/suselinux/">Suse 10</a> is a beautiful Linux distro.   I just installed it on a clunker of a machine and it's running pretty nicely.
