<a href="http://www.xanga.com/iwoulddrown">Jared</a> showed me <a href="http://www.zombietime.com/walk_for_life/">this site</a> just the other day.  It is rather startling.  The site documents a Walk for Life (pro-life) march held in San Francisco recently.  The difference in sides is amazing and speaks for itself.  The pro-life marchers moved together as one grand message, powerfully making their point.  They didn't use hateful or angry propaganda.  The pro-choice (seemed more like anti-moral) side was a very different story.  Anarchists, socialists and general odd people marched around the pro-lifers, tossing insults and threats, among other things.  They had no unity, no logical connection with each other.  One poster says "Down with the fascist president", the next says "support socialism".  Any clear thinking individual should see the pro-choice crowd spoke volumes in favor of the pro-life crowd by their actions, appearence, and general illogical behavior.
